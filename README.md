 This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), the famous cellular automata, in C. 
 
 The game can be paused by pressing the spacebar. While the game is paused, you can click left to draw or right to erase cells. The 'R' key fills the board with random data. Pressing 'E' will erase the entire board. With ',' and '.', you can decrease and increase the simulation speed, respectively. As well, '+' (or '=') and '-' zoom in and out. 'Q' or 'ESC' will exit the program.

### Command Line Options

 The scale can be set with -p or --pixsize. -d and --delay specify the simulation speed. -g and --grid make the grid overlay always on. -s and --size take parameters WIDTH and HEIGHT, and set the board to WIDTHxHEIGHT cells.
