    This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, the famous  
                  cellular automata game, in C.
  
  
                     It uses the SDL2 library.  
  
  
#                         BACKGROUND  
  
  The Game of Life was created in 1970 by John Horton Conway. It is a  
      basic simulation of life, and is in fact Turing-complete.  
  
##  The rules of Conway's Game of Life are as follows:  
  
    1. Living cells with less than two live neighbours dies.  
    2. Living cells with two or three living neighbours survives.
    3. Living cells with more than three neighbours dies.
    4. Dead cells with three live neighbours becomes a living cell.
